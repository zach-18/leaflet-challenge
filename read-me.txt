Leaflet Challenge homework.

Summary:  The homework assignment was not fully completed due to the following reasons:
- I had an extremely busy week at work.  (Post Holiday, several large project kick-offs)
- We are working on Project 2 at the same time, where I needed to build the SQL database, and clean some data.
- My Tutor cancelled my session 3 hours before our call yesterday evening because he started a new job.

Completed Work:
Index.html is linked to logic2.1.js, which creates a map, calls earthquakes, and has a functioning console.log
that calls data.

Index copy.html is linked to logic.10.js which created a map, created a circle, but I did not have time to have 
a working call of earthquake data.

Once again, because of a busy work and class week, and having my Tutor cancel, I did not get as far
as I wanted to get this week.

I did put in a lot of time as you can see from the quantity of git commits, it was just a challenging assignment
for me.

Thank you,
Phil Zach


1, I used the easiest activity, (17.1) to link the index.html to 
a logic.js file that called a map.

2, I used 17.10, which is the earthquake exercise to call an earthquake map

3, I used the query url that calls the most updated earthquakes.  It worked,
but it is very slow.  therefore, I will build the code based on the previous
static query so that my computer is not overly slowed down.

4, I looked at exercise 17.1.7 which used circles, changed their colors, and sizes.

5, I tried adding circles to the original earthquake file with the updated data
source, but it did not work &logic.2.1copy

6, I tried using 17.1.7, substituing data source to have circles on earthquake spots.
(logic.3.1

7.  I created Logic.10 to start fresh.  

8.  My TA helped me clean up my call to the URL on Logic 2.1, and the console 
finally works.

9.  Next is to bring it together.

10.  I created Logic.11 after Tuesday's office hours, and I took notes on a different 
approach to call the URL.
