Leaflet Challenge homework.

1, I used the easiest activity, (17.1) to link the index.html to 
a logic.js file that called a map.

2, I used 17.10, which is the earthquake exercise to call an earthquake map

3, I used the query url that calls the most updated earthquakes.  It worked,
but it is very slow.  therefore, I will build the code based on the previous
static query so that my computer is not overly slowed down.

4, I looked at exercise 17.1.7 which used circles, changed their colors, and sizes.

5, I tried adding circles to the original earthquake file with the updated data
source, but it did not work &logic.2.1copy

6, I tried using 17.1.7, substituing data source to have circles on earthquake spots.
